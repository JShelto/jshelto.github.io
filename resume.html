<!-- 
I had the opportunity to take sole responsibility for building a checkout flow from scratch. I worked closely with a designer to create an intuitive process with numerous payment options. From there, I was able to completely dismantle our previous checkout flow and rebuild it from the ground up using new frameworks, effectively turning work into a valuable learning experience. -->
